//Note that during installation, Prisma automatically invokes the prisma generate command for you. In the future, you need to run this command after every change to your Prisma models to update your generated Prisma Client.

//Note The prisma generate command reads your Prisma schema and updates the generated Prisma Client library inside node_modules/@prisma/client.
