## About this project
This project contains the front and back of a committee manager. The intention is provide for the Instituto de Informática from UFRGS a better way to 
manage their committees, with a web plataform to add, edit and deactivate committees. 

## About the client side
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to install and run the project
After cloning the project, you can run:

#### `npm install`

Install all the project dependecies 

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Prisma


#### What is Prisma?

Prisma is a **next-generation ORM** that consists of these tools:

- [**Prisma Client**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client): Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
- [**Prisma Migrate**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate): Declarative data modeling & migration system
- [**Prisma Studio**](https://github.com/prisma/studio): GUI to view and edit data in your database

Prisma Client can be used in _any_ Node.js or TypeScript backend application (including serverless applications and microservices). This can be a [REST API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/prisma-in-your-stack/rest), a [GraphQL API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/prisma-in-your-stack/graphql), a gRPC API, or anything else that needs a database.

#### How does Prisma work

This section provides a high-level overview of how Prisma works and its most important technical components. For a more thorough introduction, visit the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/).

##### The Prisma schema

Every project that uses a tool from the Prisma toolkit starts with a [Prisma schema file](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema). The Prisma schema allows developers to define their _application models_ in an intuitive data modeling language. It also contains the connection to a database and defines a _generator_:

```prisma
// Data source
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
// Generator
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
// Data models
model Member {
  id    Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name  String
  is_active Boolean
  committees MemberOnCommittee[]
}

model Committee {
  id    Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  bond  String
  begin_date DateTime?
  end_date DateTime?
  term Int?
  ordinance String?
  observations String?
  is_active Boolean
  members MemberOnCommittee[]
}

model MemberOnCommittee {
  member Member @relation(fields: [member_id], references: [id])
  member_id Int // relation scalar field (used in the `@relation` attribute above)
  committee Committee @relation(fields: [committee_id], references: [id])
  committee_id Int // relation scalar field (used in the `@relation` attribute above)
  role  String? @default("Membro")
  assigned_at DateTime? @default(now())
  begin_date DateTime? @default(now())
  term Int?
  observations String?

  @@id([member_id, committee_id])
	@@map("MembersOnCommittees")
}
```

In this schema, you configure three things:

- **Data source**: Specifies your database connection (via an environment variable)
- **Generator**: Indicates that you want to generate Prisma Client
- **Data model**: Defines your application models

---

##### Scripts you should know about
https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate

For updating your SQL DB (run this when you make a structural change in the prisma model)
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name <name of migration>
```

This one opens a GUI of your BD data, try it
```bash
npx prisma studio
```

##### The Prisma data model

On this page, the focus is on the data model. You can learn more about [Data sources](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-sources) and [Generators](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/generators) on the respective docs pages.

###### Functions of Prisma models

The data model is a collection of [models](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-models). A model has two major functions:

- Represent a table in the underlying database
- Provide the foundation for the queries in the Prisma Client API

###### Getting a data model

There are two major workflows for "getting" a data model into your Prisma schema:

- Generate the data model from [introspecting](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/introspection) a database
- Manually writing the data model and mapping it to the database with [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate)

Once the data model is defined, you can [generate Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/generating-prisma-client) which will expose CRUD and more queries for the defined models. If you're using TypeScript, you'll get full type-safety for all queries (even when only retrieving the subsets of a model's fields).

---

##### Accessing your database with Prisma Client

###### Generating Prisma Client

The first step when using Prisma Client is installing its npm package:

```
npm install @prisma/client
```

Note that the installation of this package invokes the `prisma generate` command which reads your Prisma schema and _generates_ the Prisma Client code. The code will be located in `node_modules/.prisma/client`, which is exported by `node_modules/@prisma/client/index.d.ts`.

<mark>After you change your data model, you'll need to manually re-generate Prisma Client to ensure the code inside `node_modules/.prisma/client` get updated:</mark>

```
npx prisma generate
```

Refer to the documentation for more information about ["generating the Prisma client"](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/generating-prisma-client).

###### Using Prisma Client to send queries to your database

Once the Prisma Client is generated, you can import it in your code and send queries to your database. This is what the setup code looks like.

Import and instantiate Prisma Client

You can import and instantiate Prisma Client as follows:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

or

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

Now you can start sending queries via the generated Prisma Client API, here are few sample queries. Note that all Prisma Client queries return _plain old JavaScript objects_.

Learn more about the available operations in the [Prisma Client docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client) or watch this [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LggrE5kJ75I&list=PLn2e1F9Rfr6k9PnR_figWOcSHgc_erDr5&index=4) (2 min).

Retrieve all `User` records from the database

```ts
// Run inside `async` function
const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany()
```

Include the `posts` relation on each returned `User` object

```ts
// Run inside `async` function
const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: { posts: true },
})
```

Filter all `Post` records that contain `"prisma"`

```ts
// Run inside `async` function
const filteredPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [{ title: { contains: 'prisma' } }, { content: { contains: 'prisma' } }],
  },
})
```

Create a new `User` and a new `Post` record in the same query

```ts
// Run inside `async` function
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Alice',
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: { title: 'Join us for Prisma Day 2021' },
    },
  },
})
```

Update an existing `Post` record

```ts
// Run inside `async` function
const post = await prisma.post.update({
  where: { id: 42 },
  data: { published: true },
})
```

Usage with TypeScript

Note that when using TypeScript, the result of this query will be _statically typed_ so that you can't accidentally access a property that doesn't exist (and any typos are caught at compile-time). Learn more about leveraging Prisma Client's generated types on the [Advanced usage of generated types](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/advanced-usage-of-generated-types) page in the docs.
